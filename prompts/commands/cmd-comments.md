You are tasked with adding comments to code written in Node.js, CSS3, and plain JavaScript to make it more understandable for AI systems or human developers. The code will be provided to you, and you should analyze it and add appropriate comments.

To add comments to this code, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the code to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Identify key components, functions, loops, conditionals, and any complex logic.
3. Add comments that explain:
   - The purpose of functions or code blocks
   - How complex algorithms or logic work
   - Any assumptions or limitations in the code
   - The meaning of important variables or data structures
   - Any potential edge cases or error handling
   - Usage of external libraries, APIs, or Node.js modules
   - Known issues or TODO items
   - For CSS, explain the purpose of complex selectors or the reasoning behind specific style choices

When adding comments, follow these guidelines:

- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Use single-line comments for brief explanations
- Use multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
- Maintain a balanced comment density (aim for one comment per logical block or every 5-10 lines of complex code)
- Place comments directly above the relevant code or at the end of short lines
- For already well-commented or self-explanatory code, add comments only if they provide additional insight

Comment Format:
- For JavaScript and Node.js:
  - Single-line comments: Use //
  - Multi-line comments: Use /* ... */
- For CSS:
  - Use /* ... */ for all comments

Indent comments to match the code they describe.

Examples of good comments:

JavaScript/Node.js:
```javascript
// Fetch user data from the database and format it for the client
// Returns a Promise that resolves with the formatted user object
async function getUserData(userId) {
    try {
        const user = await db.users.findById(userId);
        /* 
         * Format user object:
         * - Remove sensitive information (e.g., password hash)
         * - Calculate age from birthdate
         * - Fetch and include user's latest activity
         */
        return formatUserForClient(user);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error fetching user data: ${error.message}`);
        throw new Error('Unable to retrieve user data');
    }
}
```

CSS:
```css
/* 
 * Hero section styles
 * Uses flexbox for centering and responsive design
 * Background image with overlay for better text readability
 */
.hero {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-image: url('/images/hero-bg.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    position: relative;
}

/* Semi-transparent overlay */
.hero::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

Your output should be the original code with your added comments. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure. If the original code contains comments, evaluate their usefulness and either keep, modify, or replace them as necessary.

Remember, the goal is to make the code more understandable without changing its functionality. Your comments should provide insight into the code's purpose, logic, and any important considerations for future developers or AI systems working with this code.
