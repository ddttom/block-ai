# Inline SVG Block

This is a block for displaying inline SVGs in Franklin. It takes an SVG code from the first row of a block and renders it directly, removing the container.

Please create a block to implement this functionality. The block should:

1. Extract the SVG code from the first cell of the first row.
2. Remove the container and display the SVG inline.
3. Add appropriate styling for responsive display.
4. Include error handling for invalid SVG content.

When creating the block, remember to provide:

- inline-svg.js file with the block's logic
- inline-svg.css file for styling
- README.md with usage instructions and examples
- EXAMPLE.md showing how to use the block in a Franklin document
- Sample SVG code for testing
